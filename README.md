A depth of a node is the distance between the current node and the root node.

The depth of the tree is the sum of all the depths of each individual nodes in the tree. This is the program to calculate the sum of all the depths in the given tree using both recursive method and iterative methods.
The Time complexity is O(n) as each node depth needs to be calculated and Space complexity is O(h), 'h' stands for height.
